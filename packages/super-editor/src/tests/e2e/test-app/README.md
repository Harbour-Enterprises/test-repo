# Super Editor Test App

This is a minimal test application used for end-to-end testing of the Super Editor component.

Example test scenarios that can be covered using this app include:

- Testing pagination functionality (page breaks, headers, footers)
- Verifying editor dimensions and positioning
- Testing document loading and rendering
- Validating editor toolbar interactions
- Checking collaborative editing features
- Testing document import/export capabilities
- Verifying media handling and embedding

... and any other higher level use case that can't be tested purely with unit tests.

## Usage

1. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Build the app:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. Preview the built app:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```
